Welcome to my book!

I am Omid, a cryptography enthusiast and so excited to share this journey with you. In these pages, I will walk you through everything I have learned about zero-knowledge proofs, explained in my own words. Along the way, I will point you to all the references that have guided me, so you can dive deeper if you would like.

I would love to hear from youâ€”feel free to reach out for any reason at all! Whether it is a question, a suggestion, or just to chat about the topic, I am all ears. And if you would like to contribute to the book, your input would mean the world to me.
