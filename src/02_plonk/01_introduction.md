# Plonk Proof System
This part provides an overview of the PLONK proof system for arithmetic circuits.
In this chapter, we assume the existence of a polynomial commitment scheme (e.g., the KZG commitment scheme) and show how to use such a commitment to construct the PLONK proof system.

Throughout this chapter, we denote the commitment of polynomial function $f$ as $com_f$.
