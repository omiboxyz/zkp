I am Omid and interested in cryptography, especially post-quantum cryptography and zero-knowledge proofs.

In this site, I try to explain everything I learn about zero-knowledge proofs, mainly SNARKs.

I would be happy to hear any feedback regarding the contents. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss.
